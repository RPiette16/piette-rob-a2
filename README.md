Welcome to my interactive drawing assignment! I chose to make a Black Phoenix that when you press and hold the spacebar will activate
its flames and fill the screen with sparks that pop and dissappear, as well as ashes that fall in a sort of blanket down the screen.
The ashes and sparks will reset after you let go of the spacebar. Enjoy!
